### Deposition
Contains a simulation of a deposition model where tetris like blocks are dropped, creating a growing layer of sediment. The purpose is for simulation in order to understand the structure of the deposited layer and the interface.

Implementation done for now in pyGame. The simulation can be run by calling `python main.py`. The simulation file contains the class which keeps track of the blocks and deposited layers, and the piece file contains classes for pieces (which can be varied in shape and size).
